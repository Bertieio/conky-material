## Installation

### Prerequisites

* [conky 1.9](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky/releases/tag/1.9.0) (1.10 will not work because it uses the new Lua syntax)
* [Noto Sans](https://www.google.com/get/noto/)
* [Source Code Pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro/releases/latest)

### Instructions

Copy `.conkyrc` to your home folder and `find-removable-disks` to a new folder named `.conky-scripts`.

Edit to your heart's content. Disk partitions and network interfaces will probably be different for you, so make note of that.
